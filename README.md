Aim:
To further develop both an understanding of, and a competence in, stakeholder identification, requirements
and their prioritisation, use cases, use case diagrams and descriptions, different development methods, project
planning and risk analysis, legal, ethical and privacy issues, user interfacing lo-fi prototyping, and evaluation.
These will be gained through working on the early stages of systems development of a technical helpdesk
support system. While your group is free to choose the domain in which your help desk operates, it will be
expected to accept jobs, assign them to teams or individuals for action, monitor their progress, take further
action if necessary, and close them down when they have been dealt with.
